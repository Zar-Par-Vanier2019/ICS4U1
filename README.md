# ICS4U1

Hi, my name is Parsa Zahraei. I am 17 years old and I am currently completing my final year of secondary school at Georges Vanier Secondary
school. 

My programming experince is primarily tied to the computer science courses I have taken in Highschool. In my 10th grade computer science
course I learnt Turing, in 11th grade I used Pascal, and currently in my 12th grade course I am using C#. These three languages are the 
ones I am most comfortable using.

My future aspiritations in computer science involve me using my programming language to aid me in my engineering studies and my future 
engineering/science related career. While I was previewing the first year classes for the University programs I was considering applying to,
I noticed that pratically all of them included a computer science or a computer science related course. This indicates to me that that
the importance of computer science knowledge and skills in regards to science and engineering fields is increasing. One area of interest 
for me is that of AI. AI has practical applications for almost any field, and I hope to become proficient in creating and utilising AI
programs.

What I like the most about computer science is the ability to approach problems from my own perspective. In any project,
there is always plenty of room for experimentation and improvement. 

What I like the least about computer science is dealing with issues with the compiler.
